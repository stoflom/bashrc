## Scripts

-   `ffile-copy.sh`: A powerful wrapper for `find` and `cp` to collect files into a single directory with features for handling name collisions.
-   `compare_and_delete.sh`: Finds and deletes files in a target directory that are content-duplicates of files in a reference directory.
-   `gdb-to-gpx.sh`: Converts Garmin `.gdb` files to the `.gpx` format using `gpsbabel`.
-   `cp-safe.sh`: A safe copy utility that renames the destination file with a numeric suffix if it already exists.
